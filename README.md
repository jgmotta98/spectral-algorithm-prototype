# Spectral Algorithm Prototype

* Selective filtering of spectral bands based on user-defined parameters.

* Correlation of inputted FT-IR spectra bands with the database to find the most similar compounds.

* Outputs a report with informative graphs and tables in `*.pdf` indicating the five most similar compounds.

# How to use

Use the database returned from the [Spectra Scraper](https://github.com/jgmotta98/spectra-scraper) to feed the algorithm. Use a `*.csv` file to input the FT-IR spectral data.
